### in /Exercicios-projetos-python-estudos/Geek:
ðŸ“š We have a script where I work with arrays, libraries, functions and I applied decorators just for knowledge testing
 
    Write a program that reads a matrix of 5 rows and 4 columns, containing about
    the following information about students in a subject, all of which
    integer type information:
    
    - First column: registration number
    - Second column: Test average
    - third column: Average of works
    - fourth column: Final grade
    
    Design a program that:
    - Read the first 3 information of each student
    - Calculate the final grade which is mediatests+mediaworks
    - Print the enrollment of the student who obtained the highest final grade
    - print the average of the final grades

ðŸ“š In this exercise I created a logic to calculate the least common multiple.

    I used the itertools library for a prime number generator, the program calculates a list of numbers.

ðŸ“š In this exercise I use functions in a repetitive system.
     
    Implement simple home merchandise control. for each product store a numeric code, description and quantity.
    The program must have a general inventory report, entry and withdrawal of products in stock data, and report
    of unavailable products.
